          Alex,<br /><br />
          I just woke up from this weird dream. I have a strong feeling I have
          to find this old lady though. Have you met her? Do you know her Alex?
          <br /><br />
          I found a map of Pleasantville in my hotel room. That makes me think
          of our travels Alex, and how shitty you were on reading maps. How many
          times did we get lost? I wish we could be lost together here.. I have
          never been in a town like this before. It's something strange,
          everyone is nice but it’s something, I just can't quite put my finger
          on it.<br /><br />
          I can’t wait to find you, I will find you Alex!
