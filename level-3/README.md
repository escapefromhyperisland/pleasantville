# Escape from Pleasantville - level 3

Level 3 is part of 'Escape from Pleasantville', a group coding project in which myself and five other teammates each created a level that makes up an entire game. This was created as part of Hyper Island's exploring code module, wherein we were encouraged to experiment with new technologies and think about aspects of the web experience that weren't necessarily related to code.

Escape from Pleasantville is a story of the missing Alex, told through a series of postcards. You're on a mission to find out just what happened to them, and the trail has led you to a bizarre little town called Pleasantville.

Now, in the middle of the game, you can't wait to get answers what happened and where Alex is...

This project was built with the framework A-frame.

**New things I worked with:**

- Game design and storytelling
- A-frame - Make 3D worlds and AR patterns

**Challenges:**

1. Add functionallity to the a-frame 3D world was tricky
2. Give and show the right amount of feedback to the player to make the game of a good level. Not to hard and not to easy!

**Tools and Tech stack:**

[A-frame:](https://aframe.io/) "A web framework for building 3D/AR/VR experiences"
